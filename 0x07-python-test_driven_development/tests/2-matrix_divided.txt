How to Use 2-matrix_divided.py
==============================

A module that defines a matrix division function ``matrix_divided(matrix, div)``.

Usage
=====

``matrix_divided(...)`` returns a new matrix that is a copy of the parameter
``matrix`` with all elements divided by ``div``.

::

    >>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided
    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [4, 7, 10],
    ...     [13, 16, 19]
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 4))
    [[1.0, 1.75, 2.5], [3.25, 4.0, 4.75]]

Note that quotients are rounded to a maximum of two decimal places.

::

    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [2, 4, 6],
    ...     [8, 10, 12]
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 4))
    [[0.5, 1.0, 1.5], [2.0, 2.5, 3.0]]

The original matrix is left unchanged.

::

    >>> print(matrix)
    [[2, 4, 6], [8, 10, 12]]

The function can also handle floating-point numbers.

::

    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [2.2, -4.4, 6.6],
    ...     [8.8, 11.0, -13.2]
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 4))
    [[0.55, -1.1, 1.65], [2.2, 2.75, -3.3]]

Integers and floats can be combined.

::

    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [2, -4.4, 6, 8.8, 10],
    ...     [-13.2, 14.00, 16, 17.996, 20]
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 4))
    [[0.5, -1.1, 1.5, 2.2, 2.5], [-3.3, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0]]

Invalid Matrices
==============

The parameter ``matrix`` must be a list of lists consisting of either ints or
floats. If ``matrix`` is not a list, a TypeError is raised.

::

    >>> matrix = "not a list"
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 4))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

::

    >>> matrix = None
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 4))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Note that an empty list will raise the TypeError.

::

    >>> matrix = []
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 4))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

But an empty list of lists will succeed.

::

    >>> matrix = [[]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix
